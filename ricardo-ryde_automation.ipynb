    "# Takeaways from quick exploration in Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "After quickly analyzing the file in Excel, these would be my first recommendations to management:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take superman off the streets. He's responsible for 23 of the 30 near-misses in just one day. He also has the lowest rating. If needed, use this quote:\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Today is a day for truth. The world needs to know what happened and to know what he stands for. That kind of power is very dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. End long rides. They cost the same as short ones, but leave riders very unsatisfied. They don't like it. Most importantly, that's were near misses happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Promote Hulk. Or if you had to pick just one model to mass produce, just pick Hulk. Zero near-misses, highest rating, most trips, most riders, and most revenue (by far! He brought in \\\\$514, leaving the second highest, robin, at \\\\$113 away with just above \\\\$400).\n",
    "\n",
    "    _(Uhm, Hulk is the best, and Superman is the worst. Sounds like we have an Avengers fan in the midst.)_\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Promote multiple rider \"pools\". We charge a \\\\$3 premium for 1-passenger (private) rides and that doesn't seem to discourage people from taking them or having a positive experience. And they're more lucrative than 2-rider pools. But on Oct 2nd we brought in a total of \\\\$1114 for almost 200 private rides vs. \\\\$8372 for more than 800 pools. So not only pools seem more popular, but they also bring twice as much money as private ones. The 4-rider are both particularly lucrative and have the highest rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider limiting number of riders to 4. 5-rider trips have much lower ratings (car is packed?)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Disregard all of the above. These are all based on just **one day** of data. Please don't make any rash decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users still return after near misses. Most striking is user #7 that continued to ride, even after suffering 5 near misses in one trip with superman. The user even rode superman again. He probably didn't have a choice. The same is true for other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The trips are divided in two buckets of duration: less than 30 min (aka _short trips_), and longer than one hour (_long trips_). All the near misses happen in a long trip. That's 30 near misses in 51 trips. Some trips have multiple near misses (the maximum being 5 in just one trip, by superman), and so there's 19 trips with at least one near miss. These are very high rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are multiple instances of the same car. Unless the laws of physics are being violated (or the timestamps are wrong), we must assume there is more than one superman. For example, there's a superman trip from `2018-10-02 07:12:21` to `2018-10-02 08:21:23`, and another from `2018-10-02 07:13:45` to `2018-10-02 08:32:29`. These are overlapping. More importantly, near misses happen in both these trips. So the problem is not with just one particular instance of superman, but the whole model. This happens for other cars as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prices are also divided in two buckets: \\\\$5 to \\\\$6.5 for 1 rider, and \\\\$2 to \\\\$3.5 for multiple riders (2 to 5 riders, it doesn't matter). Prices also don't seem to depend on distance. That means that total revenue is just a function of number of rides (with the exception of the 1-rider vs multiple riders price difference). We could change our pricing model to depend on distance and/or time, but riders don't seem to like long-distance rides anyway. Higher price would just make it worse!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All cars take 1 to 5 passengers. Seems to suggest they're all the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is an error in the timestamps. Later trips seem to travel back in time because they end in the same day, but much earlier. E.g. from `2018-10-02 23:59:36` to `2018-10-02 00:10:15`. I just assume the end date was meant to be `2018-10-03 00:10:15` instead (i.e. one day later). That's easy to fix by adding 1 day to the trip duration if the duration is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using python and sklearn for predictive modeling\n",
    "I usually do data exploration with python, pandas, and seaborn (for plotting). And because you probably want to evaluate my python skills, I'll do a bit of exploration here. But in the end I don't think we learned anything new that we didn't already know after exploring a bit using Excel and pivot tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards the bottom of this notebook we do a tiny bit of modeling. We'll use predictive models, but the goal is not to predict or forecast. The goal is to explore the importance of some of these features. For example, we've seen that the car matters, so does the trip duration. We analyzed most features independently, but here we're looking for more nuanced relationships, that we might have missed at first glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we should note that the sample size is very small. We add more features, but mostly are just transforms of existing ones, highly correlated. We expand the feature space a little bit, but not significantly. Again, we're not doing predictive modeling, otherwise we would worry about having too many (collinear) features. We also don't need to split the data into test and training for feature importance. Basically we're throwing out all precautions usually in place to avoid overfitting out the window just for this purpose (i.e. low sample size, feature collinearity, multi-dimensionality, no cross-validation, and class imbalance – near misses are a \"rare\" event). We could do more model if we had the time, but again, probably not worth it without more data."

Same for hours (they're circular, as in the clock resets at midnight, and so they're not really numerical). `car_id` and `region` are categorical, so we need to encode them. And sklearn models don't work with timestamps. There's multiple ways to do that, the simplest one being adding an indicator variable for each category.
