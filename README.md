# rydeAutomation

As the newest data analytics hire at an autonomous vehicle startup (Ryde Automation), you have been given an example dataset (~1000 rows, 8 columns) and are asked to suggest some business actions for Ryde based on your conclusions. We encourage you to explore the data and move in any direction that you think will benefit the company the most. If you are running short on time, please document your thought process in words and explain in detail how you would proceed if given additional time.

There is a small intentional error in the dataset to look out for! (Let us know in the report if you find it and fix it!)

This take-home exercise is meant to be open-ended. Please feel free to use whatever tools you are most comfortable with and please submit your final report in any format that best conveys your findings.
